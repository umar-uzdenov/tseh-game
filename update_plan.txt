# Plan to Move Buttons to the Bottom of the Screen

## Changes to be Made:

1. **index.html**
   - Move the `#tabs` div to the end of the body to ensure it is positioned at the bottom of the screen.

2. **style.css**
   - Update the `#tabs` styles to:
     - Set `position: fixed;` to keep it at the bottom.
     - Set `bottom: 0;` to position it at the bottom of the viewport.
     - Set `width: 100%;` to make it span the entire width of the screen.
     - Adjust `justify-content` to ensure buttons are centered.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Test the changes in a browser to ensure the buttons are fixed at the bottom and function correctly.
